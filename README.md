## Project Description
Group project developed in trio, during a weekend and 2 weekdays (totalising 4 days).

## Objective
The project had **2 distinct objectives**:
1. Derive **statistically significant insights** from a database.
2. Make a **linear regression** for a variable (in this project, we have chosen to do use the linear regression to predict the probability of a crime to happen in a given date with some given circunstances.)

## Workflow
1. **Database search and download**, finally deciding on a open source database from the [Chicago Data Portal - Crimes from 2001 to Present](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present-Dashboard/5cd6-ry5g). The resulting database had 20 years of observations, totalising 7.5 million rows.
2. **Data Cleaning** and filtering for the past 5 years (2015-2020), resulting in a database of around 1.5 million observations.
3. **Data Analysis & Visualisations**: Using `Python`, `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: to test statistically significant events.
5. **Linear Regression using OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)**: to predict crimes happening in a given date with known circonstances.
6. **Assumptions testing**: verification of the assumptions for the OLS model.


## Organization
- Repository "https://github.com/leo-cavalcante/crimes-in-chicago": you may find the main Python Notebooks produced by the team members to realize the analysis, visualisations and predictive models.
- *Group project.*

### Group members responsibilities
- **Leonardo**: full Data Cleaning, some data visualisations, 1 Hypothesis Test, the whole Linear Regression (using OLS), plus a big part of the Google Slides presentation.
- **Vina**: some data analysis, some data visualisations, 2 hypothesis tests and some slides in the Google Slides presentation.
- **Natalia**: research of database and some interesting insights, some data analysis and a few slides of the final presentation.
